For now, this folder only contains a “replication” of Nunn et al. (2011)’s paper on the origins of distrust—driven by the slave trade—in the African continent. “Replication” is in quotes because the goal was to test a different command for Instrumental Variables estimation in STATA and to interpret the results. While the conclusions were consistent with the original paper, the magnitudes of the coefficients differed.

I hope to soon have cleaned versions of the code for Ludwig & Miller (2007), where I explored Regression Discontinuity Designs. Stay tuned!
